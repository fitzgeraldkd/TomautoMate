TomautoMate is a Chrome extension to help with time management and productivity. By assigning certain browser windows to whether they're task-related or for break time, the windows will show or hide on timed intervals. The idea is to allow the user to stay focused on tasks without distractions, but also provide intermittent breaks throughout.

This extension was inspired by, but is not affiliated with, the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) developed by Francesco Cirillo.
